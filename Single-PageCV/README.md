# Simple CV Page

This is a single HTML page that works as my online CV/resume. It's all in one file with my info that people can look at online.

## What it is

It's just one HTML file that has:
- My name, job title and contact info
- My work history
- My education
- My skills
- A profile picture

## How to run/use it

1. Download the files to your computer
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
3. That's it! You'll see the CV page

## How to customize it with your own info

1. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor (like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac)
2. Change my name, job title and contact info to your own
3. Replace the work history section with your jobs
4. Replace the education section with your schools
5. Change the skills section to show your skills
6. Put your own photo in the `images` folder and name it `profile.jpg`
7. Save the file
8. Open it in a browser to see your CV

This is a simple way to have a professional CV on the web without needing to know a lot about web development.
